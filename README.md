### **Rice Type Classification**  

#### **Overview**  
This project focuses on **classifying rice types** using **PyTorch** for deep learning. The dataset consists of numerical attributes extracted from rice grains, making it ideal for **binary classification** tasks.  

#### **Dataset Description**  
The dataset includes various grain features such as **Area, Perimeter, Roundness, Aspect Ratio**, and more, which help distinguish between two rice types:  
- **Jasmine (Class = 1)**  
- **Gonen (Class = 0)**  

#### **Implementation**  
- **Deep Learning Framework**: PyTorch  
- **Model**: A neural network for binary classification  
- **Training**: Implemented with PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` for efficient batch processing  

#### **Usage**  
This dataset is great for **educational purposes, experimentation, and deep learning practice**, particularly in binary classification tasks using PyTorch.  

#### **Inspiration**  
The dataset was designed to facilitate learning in **machine learning and deep learning**, ensuring meaningful and interpretable results.
